> Gapminder Vizabi is our framework for developing maintainable visual exploration tools. It has support for mobile devices, responsiveness, localization, embedding and unified data schema.

You can freely use Vizabi to: 

- embed our chart into your web page (and modify the options if you like); 
- create a new chart based on your data; 
- extend any of our charts to create your own, or create one from scratch.
